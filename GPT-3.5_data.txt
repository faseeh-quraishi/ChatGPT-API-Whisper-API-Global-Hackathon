user:Can asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients spread the virus to others?
assistant:t appears so. Epidemiologic studies have shown that people with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus just as well as those who develop symptoms. This is one of the reasons why cloth face coverings and physical distancing measures have proven effective; they reduce spread of the virus by people who do not know they have it.
user:How common is it to have COVID-19 and not know it (i.e. asymptomatic COVID-19)?
assistant:Without universal screening, it is hard to know how many people are infected and donâ€™t know it. There have been some studies attempting to estimate the number of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who remain asymptomatic. A recent systematic review estimated that 20 percent of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection never developed symptoms at any time throughout the follow-up period. Notably, since people can test positive for COVID-19 before developing symptoms (during a pre-symptomatic period), even those who do not have symptoms at the time of diagnosis may not remain asymptomatic over time.
user:I have been identified as a close contact of a known COVID-19 case. Why do I need to quarantine if my nose test was negative?
assistant:Viral testing using a nasal swab looks for genetic material from SARS-CoV-2, which is detectable only during a certain window after infection. The incubation period for the virus is up to 14 days. So, if you have a negative test within the first few days after exposure, you could have a positive test a few days later, because it can take up to 14 days for the virus to grow and be detected in your nose. That is why the CDC recommends quarantine for 14 days for everyone with a known exposure to someone with COVID-19, even if viral testing is negative.
